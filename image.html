            Here we have the green of one of the most iconic par 3 holes in golf, number 7 at Pebble Beach Golf Links. Playing from the tour tees, pros find themselves with their shortest tee shot on the tour, coming in at just 106 yards straight down hill. Winds from the bay below you are sure to play a factor in your shot. This may be the best view from a tee box that you will ever get to experience from any golf course, should you find yourself getting lucky enough to experience playing golf at Pebble Beach.
